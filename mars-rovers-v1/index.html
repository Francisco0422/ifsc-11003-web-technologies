                <h2>Ford's Background</h2>
                <p>Ford Motor Company was founded on June 16, 1903, by Henry Ford and a group of investors in Detroit, Michigan. With a vision to make transportation accessible to everyone, Ford revolutionized the automotive industry by introducing assembly line production in 1913, dramatically reducing manufacturing time and costs. This innovation made the Model T, launched in 1908, affordable for the average American and transformed personal mobility across the world. Over the decades, Ford became a symbol of innovation, quality, and strength, expanding its lineup to include trucks, SUVs, and performance vehicles like the Mustang and F-150. The company also played a crucial role in industrial and technological development during the 20th century, including contributions to aviation and military production during wartime. Today, Ford continues to evolve, leading the shift toward electric and hybrid vehicles, smart mobility solutions, and sustainability initiatives. Guided by its mission to “build a better world where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams,” Ford remains one of the most influential automakers in history—combining its rich heritage with a forward-looking commitment to innovation, quality, and community.</p>
